# Flood Risk Modeling and Mapping using Deterministic and Probabilistic Approach
- This repository consists of Python code that was used in my master's thesis titled: Evaluating the Impact of LiDAR DEM Uncertainties on Inundation Modeling in 
Coastal Sub-Watersheds: An Exploration Via Deterministic and Probabilistic Approaches
- GSS_Thesis.py simulates the error distribution and uses that as a correction factor for LiDAR DEM, and then corrected LiDAR DEM was used in bathtub modeling of inundation using the water level obtained from the Cascade 2001 modeling, and finally, after a series of iterations of modeling, probability of flood risk map was computed using the (total no. of flooded cell counts divided by no.of iterations) times 100.
- Attribute&Reclassify.py consists of code for attribute selection based on locations to find the number of benchmarks that fall in the Land use land cover map. Similarly, it also consists of reclassifying the raster using Python code, as in ArcGIS Pro, it was complicated.
- LULC-Clip.py Consists of code for extracting the DEM based on individual land use land cover maps and mosaicking them into single rasters after correcting them using values from RMSE and LE95 as per the normal distribution of the land use land cover error.
- TPI_Computation.py comprises Topographic position and ruggedness index computations using ArcGIS Pro Notebook.
